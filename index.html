<h1> About Me </h1>
<h2> Biograghy </h2>
<p> Hey! My name is Rosalinda, I'm 17 years old from Washington State. I'm a proud Puerto Rican <br> and Mexican American. Fun fact about me is if I could have any super power it would <br> be of elasticity. Imagine the the mom AKA Elastigirl from the Incredibles. </p> 
<h2> Likes/Dislikes </h2>
<p> I'm into learning about all types of things no matter how wierd or irrevalent. And going along <br>  with that I love hearing stories from all types of people. Some things I dislike are <br> stinky, rude and disrespectful people. </p>
<h2> Fav Webpages </h2>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> Youtube </a>
<h2> Girls Who Code </h2>
<p> My partner and I made a Side Scroller game last week where our avatar Pico had to jump <br> different obstacles in his way. </p>

<h3> GWC Reflection </h3>
<p> 1. I am trying to have clear sections and uncomplicated stlyes so that my website is easy to <br> read. 
    2. The way other people used different fonts and fun formating looked cool to me. <br> They probably looked more into the CSS features. 
    3. I am most proud of learning <br> and getting down coding, to a point where I can understand it and not need a guide. Don't get <br> me wrong I still have a long way to go but I'm getting there. </p>
